<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Feb, 13, 2020 - Eagerly ask God for His kingdom and righteosness</h1>
<p>It is afraid when we see ourselves compared to the environment, and enemy around us. Even though my heart is uneasy, fear disappears finally when I remember what God has done to me and His grace. Don’t worry. If I seek the kingdom and righteousness of God, God will solve the rest. Seeking the kingdom of God means focusing on a family, a church, and a community in the Holy Spirit with love. First seek the kingdom and righteousness of God.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You may say to yourselves, “These nations are stronger than we are. How can we drive them out?” But do not be afraid of them; remember well what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt. - Deuteronomy 7:17</p></li>
<li><p>So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.-Matthew 6:31</p></li>
</ul>
<p>God asks us to pray in earnest, and desperation. Also we must yearn for an eternal house in heaven. The house of heaven cannot be hoped for unless the house of tent on earth is broken. Rather than being afraid of the earthly house to fall, we should be eager to yearn for the house of heaven. If everything goes well, worship will slip away, and we are all indulging into work and fun in the world. Then we seek to find God only when we are about to die. Am I holding everything tightly so that my earthly house will not fall? Is my sigh lamentation of despair or lamentation of repentance?</p>
<p>After graduating from Hong Kong for the last semester in college, I was able to easily enter a large company that I applied for before graduating. Everything worked out well that I was sponsored to study for masters in the US. I was proud and quit the company before my graduation. There was an expectation of getting a better place, but after that, I could not escape unemployment for a while. Only then I tried to find God, and as I attended every service and listened to the Word, my faith grew. I cried earnestly and prayed to God. It was difficult at the time, but now I can confess that it was not the temporal worldly success, but God’s grace that enabled me to hold on to the eternal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands…Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. We live by faith, not by sight. - 1 Cor 5:1,6-7</li>
