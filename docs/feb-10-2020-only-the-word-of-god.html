<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Feb. 10, 2020 - Only the Word of God</h1>
<p>God prepares the enemy at hand, pushing us down to pray. God is the Father and He has to endure us now to give us something better. Later, a confession comes out that there is nothing but the Word of God from our mouth.</p>
<ul>
<li>There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the LORD Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD. Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb. And because the LORD had closed her womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her. This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat. Elkanah her husband would say to her, “Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don’t you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don’t I mean more to you than ten sons?” Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the LORD’s temple. In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD. And she made a vow, saying, “O LORD Almighty, if you will only look upon your servant’s misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head.” - 1 Samuel 1:1-11</li>
</ul>
<p>Who is my precious partner? And where should we go together? If I believe in the Word of God and admit that I’m living the life of wanderer, I can be at peace even if I go out among wolves. Paying attention to things that don’t matter as much as God’s mission can lose my peace. So I should focus on what maters most. Peace comes from applying the Word regardless of the result, not from the result of the application. When do I have peace? I have peace when I have the Word at fellowship on Friday. It is not words of curses but words of love that give warning to us in advance that listening to the Word can make us realize and repent later when events come and we fall. The rejection of people does not affect our mission.</p>
<ul>
<li>After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go. He told them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road….But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, ‘Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near.’ - Luke 10:1-4,10,11</li>
