<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Jan. 31, 2020 - Jesus came to me through persecuting family.</h1>
<p>Gerasenes was a land of Judea bordering neighbor countries where Jews were making money by raising pigs used as offerings of foreign gods of the neighbor countries although pigs were unclean animals to Jews. There was a demonized man bothering the Jews in the land. Likewise there is a demonized and persecuting family next to me because of my hesitation between God and the world at the border. Only for this demon possessed man, Jesus came through the storm. The gospel is engraved in my heart when I pay the price of a large herd of pigs for the free grace of my salvation. To the healed man, Jesus told to return home and tell his family the great things God has done to him. Jesus came to me through my father, who caused financial struggling to my family and my mother, who was confused by different faith while I was hesitating at the boundary between God and the world of success. The Gospel was minded in my heart through losing my job, and paying the price of my mother’s cancer. God tells me to go back to my family and tell the gospel to my brothers and father who don’t know God yet.</p>
<ul>
<li>One day Jesus said to his disciples, “Let’s go over to the other side of the lake.” So they got into a boat and set out. As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger…They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee….When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned….The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, “Return home and tell how much God has done for you.” So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him. - Luke 8:22,23,26,33,38,39</li>
