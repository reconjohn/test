<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.1</span> Even though trying self-effort,</h2>
<p>Even though God told Ahab would die if he goes to war, he eventually goes to war without discerning. The result is obvious. Ahab dies as the Word said. It’s a blessing that the Word comes true regardless of whether it is auspicious or ominous. It is a great grace to meditate on the Words every day. As if Micaiah’s ominous prophecy was disturbing, Ahab dressed Jehoshaphat, king of Judah with royal robes and disguised himself to a normal soldier on the battlefield. Nevertheless, every his effort is useless because there is a God who watches over the unrepentant and prepares a sword and a bow. What do I disguise to win?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If he does not relent, he will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow. -Psalms. 7:12</p></li>
<li><p>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle. - 1 King 22:30</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="even-though-relying-on-a-chariot" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.2</span> Even though relying on a chariot,</h2>
<p>Ahab had a confidence that he defeated the united Aram army with a few troops in previous battles and, most importantly, he had chariots. In the Bible, the word chariot appears in every battle-related passage in 22: 31-35. Chariots at that time were powerful weapons such as tanks these days. So what is my chariot that I rely on as a strong weapons?</p>
<p>Commanders of the Aram army, who mistook Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah for Ahab, attacked Jehoshaphat in unison. Jehoshaphat screamed, and the commanders who attacked him who was crying to God left him. Am I crying to God when suffering?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.” When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, “Surely this is the king of Israel.” So they turned to attack him, but when Jehoshaphat cried out, the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel and stopped pursuing him. - 1 Kings 22: 31-33</p></li>
<li><p>When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, “This is the king of Israel.” So they turned to attack him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him. God drew them away from him, -2 Chronicles 18:31</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="even-though-it-looks-coincidence" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.3</span> Even though it looks coincidence,</h2>
<p>The words, “Involuntarily, random, and coincidentally”, are in connection with faithfulness and wholeness in the original language. Ahab, who, under God’s control, died in the evening with very small probability of being hit by an arrow at the seam between the armor, enough to survive just one day. Wasn’t it the opportunity of repentance and salvation that God gave to Ahab until the very end of his life that he did not just die right away but survive at least a few more hours till the evening? He would have thought a lot about himself dying such as the vineyards of Naboth he had taken, Elijah who killed the prophets of Baal, Micaiah who gave him a bad prophecy, or Jezebel, whom he loved. Did he realize God’s love that he could still have time to repent and turn away? There was enough time for him to repent. The Bible says that Ahab slept with his ancestors. It is very rarely recorded that the evil kings slept with their ancestors, and I believe through the verse that Ahab slept with his ancestors that Ahab, seeing himself dying, repented and turned to God before he died.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told his chariot driver, “Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I’ve been wounded.” - 1 King 22: 34</p></li>
<li><p>Ahab rested with his fathers. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king. - 1 King 22: 40</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="as-the-dogs-licked-up-his-blood" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.4</span> As the dogs licked up his blood,</h2>
<p>As Ahab dies, the people return to their homes, as the Word said. Only Ahab was judged, yet we can see God’s love for Israel that they all returned to their homes. God has already spoken to Ahab through the prophets saying that King Aram of Ben-hadad was released with false mercy from Ahab that he would take the place of Ben-hadad’s life and in war, Ahab would die and the people would return to their homes in peace. And the dog would lick Ahab’s blood.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>He said to the king, “This is what the LORD says: ‘You have set free a man I had determined should die. Therefore it is your life for his life, your people for his people.’”- 1 King 20:42</p></li>
<li><p>Then Micaiah answered, “I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD said, ‘These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.’”.-1 King 22:17</p></li>
<li><p>Say to him, ‘This is what the LORD says: Have you not murdered a man and seized his property?’ Then say to him, ‘This is what the LORD says: In the place where dogs licked up Naboth’s blood, dogs will lick up your blood–yes, yours!’ "- 1 King 21:19</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And it all came true like the Word said.</p>
<ul>
<li>As the sun was setting, a cry spread through the army: “Every man to his town; everyone to his land!” So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried him there They washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria (where the prostitutes bathed), and the dogs licked up his blood, as the word of the LORD had declared - 1 King 22:36-38</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="judgement-on-earth-is-a-blessing" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.5</span> Judgement on earth is a blessing</h2>
<p>We are like Ahab who married Princess Jezebel from a wonderful royal family in the world seeking money, education and good looks regardless of faith. Like Ahab, who stole Naboth’s vineyard, we speculates on stocks and real estate for our greed. We are all like Ahab, who wanted to be recognized as cool, kind, and generous regardless of the salvation of the other but for the benefit of the future that he released Ben-hadad who should be killed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we could see Ahab keeping asking God through the prophets until he dies. Ahab was in agony due to Naboth’s vineyard that he could not take it easily, which would have been taken easily if he was a gentile king like Jezebel, his wife took it easily by forcing. Ahab also listened to Elijah’s words that he summoned the 800 prophets of Baal and the Asherah. After taking Naboth’s vineyard, Ahab listened to the word of judgment and was troubled and repented also. But he continued to do evil encouraged by Jezebel, and was blinded by greed and pride, and finally he was judged on earth.</p>
<p>Judgment after death is curse, but judgment on earth is a blessing as there is still a chance of repentance. God judged Ahab, but by the time of the evening which God allowed Ahab to survive, Ahab was given the opportunity to repent. Unlike other kings, Ahab is written in the Bible in dozens of chapters. I see it is Ahab’s mission that brought up the great prophet Elijah of the day to come out and Ahab himself became the lessons which teach us how to live with Word. In this regard, Ahab seems to have fulfilled his mission that God used him for us to reflect on his life. There is love of God who accomplishes our salvation by showing Ahab’s life that help us realize that in fact we are Ahab.</p>
