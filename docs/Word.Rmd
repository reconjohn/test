# I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. - Galatians 2:20 {#index}

I'd be the moon so I can reflect the shine from God on you during your darkest hours.

# Feb, 13, 2020 - Eagerly ask God for His kingdom and righteosness

It is afraid when we see ourselves compared to the environment, and enemy around us. Even though my heart is uneasy, fear disappears finally when I remember what God has done to me and His grace. Don't worry. If I seek the kingdom and righteousness of God, God will solve the rest. Seeking the kingdom of God means focusing on a family, a church, and a community in the Holy Spirit with love. First seek the kingdom and righteousness of God.

- You may say to yourselves, "These nations are stronger than we are. How can we drive them out?" But do not be afraid of them; remember well what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt. - Deuteronomy 7:17

- So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.-Matthew 6:31

God asks us to pray in earnest, and desperation. Also we must yearn for an eternal house in heaven. The house of heaven cannot be hoped for unless the house of tent on earth is broken. Rather than being afraid of the earthly house to fall, we should be eager to yearn for the house of heaven. If everything goes well, worship will slip away, and we are all indulging into work and fun in the world. Then we seek to find God only when we are about to die. Am I holding everything tightly so that my earthly house will not fall? Is my sigh lamentation of despair or lamentation of repentance?

After graduating from Hong Kong for the last semester in college, I was able to easily enter a large company that I applied for before graduating. Everything worked out well that I was sponsored to study for masters in the US. I was proud and quit the company before my graduation. There was an expectation of getting a better place, but after that, I could not escape unemployment for a while. Only then I tried to find God, and as I attended every service and listened to the Word, my faith grew. I cried earnestly and prayed to God. It was difficult at the time, but now I can confess that it was not the temporal worldly success, but God's grace that enabled me to hold on to the eternal.

- Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands...Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. We live by faith, not by sight. - 1 Cor 5:1,6-7


# Feb. 12, 2020 - Focus on Word in faith rather than self-effort then apply it

The essence of the Word is to love God and neighbor, not just knowing, but applying to our daily lives. Jesus told the Samaritan, whom the Jews regarded as lowly at that time, as a neighbor to the person who had been robbed rather than a priest of the Jews who didn't care the person. Jesus asks who is the neighbor? I think the pastor of the church in Seattle is my neighbor who gives me the opportunity to serve God through praise and worship interpretation and provides meals every meeting. My friends who listen and empathize with me, and above all, the friend who always prays and cares for me seem to be my neighbors. I also want to be a neighbor to them by empathizing with them and satisfying their needs.

- He answered: " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'" "You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will live."..."Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?" The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him." Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise." - Luke 10:27,28,36,37

Martha eventually missed what is most important because of her self-effort to serve Jesus while maybe seeking acknowledgement or pleasing Him. Mary only focused on Jesus, the truth and the Word and she was confirmed that she chose the better. Martha tried to please Jesus while she might want Jesus to give her credit for doing things for Jesus while Maria focused on Jesus alone. We are all Martha seeking self-effort to please God. But God keeps saying, "no, just trust me, focus on me, and have your eyes only on me." Rather than trying to please God, trusting Him will please God after all. 

- But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, "Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!" "Martha, Martha," the Lord answered, "you are worried and upset about many things, but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her." - Luke 10:40-42

- And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. - Hebrews 11:6

# Feb. 11, 2020 - Rejoice with Word

God tells us to rejoice that we are saved by God's grace, not by power, our deeds, or miracles, because our names are written in heaven. I am pleased to be involved in the salvation that God has already accomplished. What have I been pleased with lately? I has experienced a miracle of having a precious person into my life. But more than that, I'm pleased that the person helps me understand God and the Word more and from the different perspective. 

- However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven." - Luke 10:20

Suffering is a blessing because of which I realize my weaknesses. Do I appreciate the Word that many prophets and kings wanted to see and hear, the Word that has been given to me? Even if the Word does not be fully understood now, it must be heard and become a seed, and when I fall down or an event occurs, my salvation will be accomplished through the seed.

- For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it." - Luke 10:24

# Feb. 10, 2020 - Only the Word of God

God prepares the enemy at hand, pushing us down to pray. God is the Father and He has to endure us now to give us something better. Later, a confession comes out that there is nothing but the Word of God from our mouth.

- There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the LORD Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD. Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb. And because the LORD had closed her womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her. This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat. Elkanah her husband would say to her, "Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don't you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?" Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the LORD's temple. In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD. And she made a vow, saying, "O LORD Almighty, if you will only look upon your servant's misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head." - 1 Samuel 1:1-11

Who is my precious partner? And where should we go together? If I believe in the Word of God and admit that I'm living the life of wanderer, I can be at peace even if I go out among wolves. Paying attention to things that don't matter as much as God's mission can lose my peace. So I should focus on what maters most. Peace comes from applying the Word regardless of the result, not from the result of the application. When do I have peace? I have peace when I have the Word at fellowship on Friday. It is not words of curses but words of love that give warning to us in advance that listening to the Word can make us realize and repent later when events come and we fall. The rejection of people does not affect our mission.

- After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go. He told them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road....But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, 'Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near.' - Luke 10:1-4,10,11

# Feb. 9, 2020 - God standing by our sins, or warning us

It is a human nature to be lazy that God comes to play a role to give us some events which make us awake if we failed to be alert. Sometimes God allows us to be lazy or even committing sins as long as those are adding up to our salvation. In other words, God stands by our sins for our salvation, and sometimes God gave us warnings. It is to allow us to realize and repent, experience the grace of God and grow more when God stands by our sins. For example, God didn't warn David who committed adultery because this would help David to grow in Spirit and for his salvation after all. On the other hand, God interrupted Ahab by sending prophets to give him warnings which may have helped Ahab later on as a "seed" to reflect on himself and repent. Furthermore, Peter denied Jesus three times while he already heard from Jesus warning that he would deny three times which as a seed, helped him to repent after his denial. 

God gives warnings to those who are not ready like infant in faith and the warnings as seeds help them to understand more about God and His love and grow in spirit after they fail. On the other hand, God doesn't warn those or God stands by those who are able to deal with the mistakes leading to their salvation too because God won't let us be tempted beyond what we can bear. If we failed and fall into sin and mistakes, even if we tried hard, there is a plan from God related to the mistakes that helps us to grow in spirit after all as God uses everything good or bad for our salvation as we can see many examples of those sins of faithful ancestors in the Bible. Abraham, and Jacob, were not perfect, and had many weaknesses. They sometimes rebelled against God and sinned, but God still used them. God's plan is not thwarted by our mistakes. So, we can stand firm regardless of our weakness by faith in God and His goodness. Faith is trusting God in our daily life.

- No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it. - 1 Corinthians 10:13

# Feb. 8, 2020 - The Word comes true

## Even though trying self-effort,

Even though God told Ahab would die if he goes to war, he eventually goes to war without discerning. The result is obvious. Ahab dies as the Word said. It's a blessing that the Word comes true regardless of whether it is auspicious or ominous. It is a great grace to meditate on the Words every day. As if Micaiah's ominous prophecy was disturbing, Ahab dressed Jehoshaphat, king of Judah with royal robes and disguised himself to a normal soldier on the battlefield. Nevertheless, every his effort is useless because there is a God who watches over the unrepentant and prepares a sword and a bow. What do I disguise to win?

- If he does not relent, he will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow. -Psalms. 7:12

- The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle. - 1 King 22:30

## Even though relying on a chariot,

Ahab had a confidence that he defeated the united Aram army with a few troops in previous battles and, most importantly, he had chariots. In the Bible, the word chariot appears in every battle-related passage in 22: 31-35. Chariots at that time were powerful weapons such as tanks these days. So what is my chariot that I rely on as a strong weapons?

Commanders of the Aram army, who mistook Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah for Ahab, attacked Jehoshaphat in unison. Jehoshaphat screamed, and the commanders who attacked him who was crying to God left him. Am I crying to God when suffering? 

- Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel." When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, "Surely this is the king of Israel." So they turned to attack him, but when Jehoshaphat cried out, the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel and stopped pursuing him. - 1 Kings 22: 31-33

- When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, "This is the king of Israel." So they turned to attack him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him. God drew them away from him, -2 Chronicles 18:31

## Even though it looks coincidence, 

The words, "Involuntarily, random, and coincidentally", are in connection with faithfulness and wholeness in the original language. Ahab, who, under God's control, died in the evening with   very small probability of being hit by an arrow at the seam between the armor, enough to survive just one day. Wasn't it the opportunity of repentance and salvation that God gave to Ahab until the very end of his life that he did not just die right away but survive at least a few more hours till the evening? He would have thought a lot about himself dying such as the vineyards of Naboth he had taken, Elijah who killed the prophets of Baal, Micaiah who gave him a bad prophecy, or Jezebel, whom he loved. Did he realize God's love that he could still have time to repent and turn away? There was enough time for him to repent. The Bible says that Ahab slept with his ancestors. It is very rarely recorded that the evil kings slept with their ancestors, and I believe through the verse that Ahab slept with his ancestors that Ahab, seeing himself dying, repented and turned to God before he died.

- But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told his chariot driver, "Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded." - 1 King 22: 34

- Ahab rested with his fathers. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king. - 1 King 22: 40

## As the dogs licked up his blood, 

As Ahab dies, the people return to their homes, as the Word said. Only Ahab was judged, yet we can see God's love for Israel that they all returned to their homes. God has already spoken to Ahab through the prophets saying that King Aram of Ben-hadad was released with false mercy from Ahab that he would take the place of Ben-hadad's life and in war, Ahab would die and the people would return to their homes in peace. And the dog would lick Ahab's blood.

- He said to the king, "This is what the LORD says: 'You have set free a man I had determined should die. Therefore it is your life for his life, your people for his people.' "- 1 King 20:42

- Then Micaiah answered, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD said, 'These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.' ".-1 King 22:17

- Say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: Have you not murdered a man and seized his property?' Then say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: In the place where dogs licked up Naboth's blood, dogs will lick up your blood--yes, yours!' "- 1 King 21:19

And it all came true like the Word said.

- As the sun was setting, a cry spread through the army: "Every man to his town; everyone to his land!" So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried him there They washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria (where the prostitutes bathed), and the dogs licked up his blood, as the word of the LORD had declared - 1 King 22:36-38

## Judgement on earth is a blessing

We are like Ahab who married Princess Jezebel from a wonderful royal family in the world seeking money, education and good looks regardless of faith. Like Ahab, who stole Naboth's vineyard, we speculates on stocks and real estate for our greed. We are all like Ahab, who wanted to be recognized as cool, kind, and generous regardless of the salvation of the other but for the benefit of the future that he released Ben-hadad who should be killed. 

Nevertheless, we could see Ahab keeping asking God through the prophets until he dies. Ahab was in agony due to Naboth's vineyard that he could not take it easily, which would have been taken easily if he was a gentile king like Jezebel, his wife took it easily by forcing. Ahab also listened to Elijah's words that he summoned the 800 prophets of Baal and the Asherah. After taking Naboth's vineyard, Ahab listened to the word of judgment and was troubled and repented also. But he continued to do evil encouraged by Jezebel, and was blinded by greed and pride, and finally he was judged on earth. 

Judgment after death is curse, but judgment on earth is a blessing as there is still a chance of repentance. God judged Ahab, but by the time of the evening which God allowed Ahab to survive, Ahab was given the opportunity to repent. Unlike other kings, Ahab is written in the Bible in dozens of chapters. I see it is Ahab's mission that brought up the great prophet Elijah of the day to come out and Ahab himself became the lessons which teach us how to live with Word. In this regard, Ahab seems to have fulfilled his mission that God used him for us to reflect on his life. There is love of God who accomplishes our salvation by showing Ahab's life that help us realize that in fact we are Ahab.

# Feb. 7, 2020 - God provides what I need

One of my friends asked why I have many items from free such as a laptop, tumblers, bikes, bags, and so on. I had been thinking about it and while I was at Church community, where I ate the best meal once a week, got some food and a heater for a new place, and enjoyed the fellowship where I feel restored and recharged, I realized God is the one who has provided me with what I need exactly. I feel His grace and presence. 

- At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his forces said to Abraham, "God is with you in everything you do. - Genesis 21:22

- They answered, "We saw clearly that the LORD was with you; so we said, 'There ought to be a sworn agreement between us'-between us and you. Let us make a treaty with you that you will do us no harm, just as we did not molest you but always treated you well and sent you away in peace. And now you are blessed by the LORD." - Genesis 26:28-29

- But Laban said to him, "If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you." - Genesis 30:27

- So Pharaoh asked them, "Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God ?" - Genesis 41:38

For our families who are yet hard for us to reach out with the gospel, we can still be a peacemaker to introduce the love of God to them. 

- Peacemakers who sow in peace raise a harvest of righteousness.	- James 3:18

- Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God. - Matt 5:9

# Feb. 5, 2020 - Taking up the cross by letting go of anger, lust and greed 

Jesus cares more about how the disciples think about Him than how the crowd thinks about him. At last Peter confesses that Jesus is the Messiah, and Jesus discerns the time to come and tells His disciples that He will die in the future. It is a paradox that He must die to come back to life. It is self denial that I let go of my anger, lust and greed and this is how to die. The martyrdom of this generation is said to tolerate the anger. It is the professor who makes me angry these days. Every time he insults my character with his arrogance, it hurts. But it is said that I die when I respect him. It is said that I take up the cross when I honor my father who has been arguing with me recently in Korea. A disciple's life is to bear the cross and sacrifice by obeying Jesus. Soon I leave the house I have been comfortable with and move to an unfamiliar, uncomfortable place. I try to be glad as I am going to take up the cross of this undesirable and uncomfortable situation instead of the other person leaving the house.

- For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. - Romans 10:10

- "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "The Christ of God." Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. And he said, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life." Then he said to them all: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. - Luke 9:20-23


# Feb. 4, 2020 - Staying or leaving based on salvation

Jesus goes to Bethsaida, the hometown of the fishermen, Peter, Andrew and Phillip, so that the disciples who return after evangelism can rest, but people, who desperately need Jesus for their sake, do not leave them alone. Luke chapter 4 shows the different image of Jesus who left people to preach the gospel in the other town, and chapter 5 shows Jesus moved to a secluded place to pray when the crowd came. We should know that there are times to leave and to stay like Jesus for salvation. Even if I will get gold, if it does not help salvation, I must leave. Even if suffering comes, if it helps salvation, I must stay. When salvation becomes the purpose, there are times when what is always right is not right, and what is not right is right.

- When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida, but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing. - Luke 9:10-11

Thinking reasonably and rationally is different from having faith in Jesus who can do everything. Jesus focuses on bringing up the disciples by emphasizing faith and showing the miracle. Even if what I have seems a little, Jesus tells me to bring it. This results in abundant overflow. What do I have to feed people today?

- He replied, "You give them something to eat." They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish--unless we go and buy food for all this crowd."...Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to set before the people. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. - Luke 9:13, 16-17

# Feb. 3, 2020 - Stay focused on my role as God provides what needed

If you have a lot, you will not be able to focus on the mission, instead you will only be concerned about things you have. Jesus tells us to believe in God's provision, not to worry, and not to be overly prepared. As my mother recently got cancer, she had expensive cancer insurance for me in case I get it in the future. I felt it was too much that told my mother and terminated the insurance contract. Excessive preparation beyond the proper level may be the result of untrusting God. We better use the resources God gave us wise. 

He told me to stay well and still in the same place until I leave for my next mission. When I am faithful to the current role of son or daughter where I am now, I will become well prepared and able to leave in the right time. Nevertheless, Jesus tells us to dust off for family and friends who do not hear the Gospel. Dust means the worldly comfort they give to me. I should not neglect to preach the gospel due to the servile spirit of the comfort they give me. The environment where I do not have what I need now is for me to fulfill my purpose of becoming Jesus-like. I expect God to give me what I need in the right time.

- He told them: "Take nothing for the journey--no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra tunic. Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town. If people do not welcome you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave their town, as a testimony against them." - Luke 9: 3-5

# Feb. 1, 2020 - Being humble acknowledging my weakness with faith in Jesus saves me

The event of Jairus's sick daughter reveals that his religious rituals, and the law, the old values, cannot save a person. Jairus released his pride and fell to Jesus, the gospel, the new values, asking Him to save his daughter. As Jesus came to earth, He now saves people with the new gospel, the new wineskins, not the old law, the old wineskins. A woman with bleeding for 12 years and a 12-year-old daughter of Jairus,  are experiencing the gospel of Jesus. 12 is the perfect number, indicating that the limit of life, the time of salvation, has come near.

- And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, he pours new wine into new wineskins." - Mark 2:22

- Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her. - Luke 8:41-43

A woman with bleeding disease was isolated from society because of her illness, and she lost the sense of security that comes from belonging to a community and the safety that comes from possessing as she spent her fortune to cure her illness. Unlike Jairus, who fell down to Jesus, she recognized her humble state after losing her basic desires of safety and security, and she did not dare to come to Jesus. Instead, she came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of His cloak in secret. The woman's behavior at the time was a level of assault, because according to the law, contact with a sick person is unclean leading to separation for a while from the society. But Jesus calls her actions as faith, not assault. Her fear for people is turning into awe for God after being healed. Jesus calls the woman daughter and she is the only one being called daughter throughout the Bible. By believing in Jesus, we have a new identity and become children and daughters of God. Jesus now touches her wounds of insecurity that have been lost in isolation by publicly calling a woman out of a prison alone and proclaiming her return to community. Peace is now upon the woman who is a child and daughter of God by faith. There were many who touched Jesus, but only this woman of faith was healed and called  daughter by Jesus. When I come to Jesus with faith and thorough acknowledgment of my humbleness and incompetence, my sickness is healed, peace comes, and I become a child of God.

- Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God--John 1:12

- She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped...Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace." - Luck 8: 44,47-48

# Jan. 31, 2020 - Jesus came to me through persecuting family

Gerasenes was a land of Judea bordering neighbor countries where Jews were making money by raising pigs used as offerings of foreign gods of the neighbor countries although pigs were unclean animals to Jews. There was a demonized man bothering the Jews in the land. Likewise there is a demonized and persecuting family next to me because of my hesitation between God and the world at the border. Only for this demon possessed man, Jesus came through the storm. The gospel is engraved in my heart when I pay the price of a large herd of pigs for the free grace of my salvation. To the healed man, Jesus told to return home and tell his family the great things God has done to him. Jesus came to me through my father, who caused financial struggling to my family and my mother, who was confused by different faith while I was hesitating at the boundary between God and the world of success. The Gospel was minded in my heart through losing my job, and paying the price of my mother's cancer. God tells me to go back to my family and tell the gospel to my brothers and father who don't know God yet.

- One day Jesus said to his disciples, "Let's go over to the other side of the lake." So they got into a boat and set out. As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger...They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee....When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned....The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, "Return home and tell how much God has done for you." So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him. - Luke 8:22,23,26,33,38,39

# Jan. 30, 2020 - True love for family

We should overcome the family idols. Faith and family are separate. Family idols can be an obstacle to faith. Family is not the idols we depend on but the ones we share the gospel for their salvation. We should look at our family objectively like Jesus did. 

- Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you." He replied, "My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice." - Luke 7:20-21

What is it to love family or people? Is it love to listen to their wishes and grant their obsessions based on their own greed? Or is it love to pray for them and help them depend on God, not me? Still, keeping my heart somewhere else and trying to accommodate their obsessive needs is not love but more betrayal. Wouldn't it be a true love to recognize my irreversible heart and weakness, leave it to God, go forward with hope that God will work, and pray for the salvation of them? Nevertheless, the focus should be on the grace of God and salvation, not on physical or emotional help for their needs. Real salvation is not to give bread to the lame for the temporal satisfaction of his need, but for him to rise, go to the temple, and praise God as Peter did to the lame. For we live by Word not by bread. 

- Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" - Matt 4:4

- He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your fathers had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD. - Duet 8:3

- Now a man crippled from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts. When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money. Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, "Look at us!" So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them. Then Peter said, "Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk." Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong. He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God. - Act 3


# Jan. 29, 2020 - Acknowledging weakness and bring it to God while expecting His work for salvation

It is good to feel pity and compassion for people, but above all, think of their salvation first. More importantly, whether they are really closer to God and more dependent on God rather than their emotional or physical pains. Even if their hearts hurt, it's only a moment, and if they rely more on God through this event, it becomes an event of salvation. 

All things are possible with God. But since each of us has its own level of faith at the moment, it is often difficult for us to keep what is right. It is on going process that we become growing in spirit. We do our best to keep the word of God, and what is right, but nevertheless, we should acknowledge our weakness that sometimes we fail to keep it and expect God to work through it. We grow further through this process. The more we focus on our effort, the more desperate and heavier we will feel. We should no longer condemn ourselves for our weakness, rather bring it to God and expect how God is going to work and enjoy grace and freedom.

1. What is the definition of becoming righteous? Not by committing no sin but by faith. We can hurt people. We can keep falling and sinning. But this cannot affect the fact that we are righteous because It is considered righteous by faith. For we are bound to sin and keep failing to do the right things. 

- being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.” The words “it was credited to him” were written not for him alone, but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness–for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification. - Romans 4:21-25

2. My actions and desires can hurt people. Jacob's desire for birthright hurt his brother, Esau as much as he wanted to kill Jacob. Tamar's desire to belong to God's people made adultery for his father-in-law, left a great wound for Judah. Rahab craving for God, killed all her people. While Jacob, Tamar, and Rahab were longing for God's kingdom and spiritual blessings and hurting people at the same time, but David's lust for Bathsheba was not just hurting, but even killed Uriah, the husband of her. Jacob escaped from his brother, sanctified through his rugged life enough to bless the King of Egypt at his older age. Tamar became the symbol of the blessing of giving birth to a spiritual child, and Judah became Israel's spiritual firstborn through the shameful event of sleeping with his daughter in law, the turning point of his life. Rahab, the gentile and prostitute, gave birth to Boaz and became the ancestor of Jesus, also she saved his family. David also gave birth to Solomon through Bathsheba and continued the spiritual lineage of Jesus. Those are the images of our daily lives like Jesus' forefather, Jacob, Judah, Tamar, Rahab, and David that they are not any better than us when it comes to weakness and sins. It is important to admit that we are as weak as we know what is right but cannot keep it and continue to sin. We must bring our weakness to God.

3. Our weakness and falling event sometimes becomes an event to be necessary and an event of salvation. Jacob's desire of seeking spiritual blessings or David's desire to satisfy his lust eventually served to become more holy, experience the grace of God and spiritual growth. At the end, we can expect God to work together with our weakness for good and how God is going to sanctify us through these events.

# Jan. 28, 2020 - Forgiven, so we love God 
 
A woman still living in sin had already heard about Jesus, and she had received the grace of His word, and she had the opportunity to meet Him in person finally. By loving Jesus with gratitude for the grace received, she breaks the expensive perfume and washes Jesus' feet with it. Jesus publicly declares that the sin of a woman is forgiven. 

It is not that I have been forgiven of my sins because I love God, but that I have already been forgiven freely by grace first, and I love God as a result. As the story of the two men forgiven the debt, the debt was already forgiven freely by grace. Likewise, my sins have already been forgiven by the blood of Jesus. All I have to do is to believe it and love God. To the woman forgiven by faith, Jesus tells her to go in peace. But even after the remission of sins, the woman's environment will remain the same with shame and humiliation. However, she can now be at peace with faith in Jesus, not in environment or humanity condemnation anymore. Jesus showed that He did not judge or condemn our weakness, nor our sins, but more focus on our physical and spiritual needs. Later, when we stand for judgement before God, He will see how much we loved God and neighbor, not how much we sinned as Jesus showed us when He was here.  

- When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume,...Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?"...Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven--for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little." Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven." The other guests began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?" Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace." - Luke 7:37, 42, 47-50

- being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. This is why "it was credited to him as righteousness." The words "it was credited to him" were written not for him alone, but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness--for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification. - Romans 4:21-25

 
# Jan. 18, 2020 - God prepares my salvation knowing my weakness
 
I meditated on Jacob, who deceived his brother, Esau, and ran away. Isaac, the father, tried to bless Esau, but Jacob deceived his father and got blessed. Jacob was running away from the angry Esau who tried to kill Jacob. Esau was clearly a victim. But God was with Jacob. If Jacob had not lied and deceived, Esau would have been blessed, so would Esau, not Jacob, become the father of God's people? It seems that God already knew the end and chose Jacob from the beginning. God already knew the nature of Jacob, who lied and deceived, and God completed his salvation in consideration of Jacob's free will. Likewise, God knows my good, the weak, the sin, the failure, everything that is going to happen, and leads me in a good way under His plan. 

- His father Isaac asked him, "Who are you?" "I am your son," he answered, "your firstborn, Esau." Isaac trembled violently and said, "Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him--and indeed he will be blessed!" When Esau heard his father's words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, "Bless me--me too, my father!" But he said, "Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing." - Genesis 27:32-35

- And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. - Romans 8:28


God (who chose Jacob from the beginning, using his weaknesses, and his free will to complete his salvation) knew what I would choose and how I would fail, and He had already set up a plan for it. At the time of the creation of heaven and earth, knowing that Adam and Eve would fall, and people couldn't keep the law, God were already telling the serpent that He would send Jesus to the earth to crush his head. Six hundred years before Jesus was born, God spoke more specifically through Isaiah. And as He said, Jesus came. 

- And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel." - Genesis 3:15

- Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel. - Isaiah 7:14

- "The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel"--which means, "God with us." - Matt 1:23


Before Peter was still growing up, despite his weakness, Jesus said that Peter would open the kingdom of God with the key of heaven. He also knew that Peter would deny Him three times, and through this event He raised and disciplined Peter, who would be greatly used as an Apostle with the key of heaven. After the resurrection, Jesus met Peter and asked him three times, do you love me? Peter was born again from the icon of despair as the holy and mighty apostle of God. God knows everything, my weaknesses, my failures, my sins that I would make in the future, and my end, and has already made plans to use them for my salvation and leading me in good ways. 

- And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven." - Matt 16:18-19

- But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven. - Matt 10:33

- Peter replied, "Man, I don't know what you're talking about!" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly. - Luke 22:60-62

- When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?" "Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my lambs." Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep." The third time he said to him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" He said, "Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you." - John 21:15-17


Later, God reluctantly gave a king to the Israelites as they had asked a king eagerly, but God had already prophesied to their forefather Jacob that kings would come from him. Timeless God already knows everything. God knows what choice I will make, my weakness, my failures, and my ends. Because He knows the end, it is certain that the Words of prophecy will be fulfilled, and we can therefore believe that all that God says will be fulfilled. Whenever I found that God prophesied knowing what is going to happen in the future, and the prophecies in the past were fulfilled later in the Bible, I feel God is amazing and reliable. My faith in God, who already knows my future and end, is growing in this regard.

- And God said to him, "I am God Almighty ; be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will come from your body. - Genesis 35:11

- They said to him, "You are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways; now appoint a king to lead us, such as all the other nations have." But when they said, "Give us a king to lead us," this displeased Samuel; so he prayed to the LORD. And the LORD told him: "Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king. - 1Samuel 8:5-7

> God knows your end, how you die, and what you will do rest of your life as well as your family. Don't worry, just leave them to God. Just enjoy His grace by  doing your best to fully trust Him, which pleases Him too. He knows your end and has prepared the plan for your salvation considering your weakness and mistakes. Everything happening has reasons. Let's trust Him. One thing for sure, you were chosen! 

> My brother talked to the leader in the church yesterday about keeping the life support or just giving up and let her go to heaven. She said nobody knows what is the way of salvation. Her father died after receiving ten days of life support. The resident doctor told her that he had to do what he had to do the best, because he had seen a lot of miracles. But after trying what he could do for 10 days, her father died. 

> "Likewise, all we have to do is not to make plans for what's going to happen in the future, but stay true to the present considering the situation where you go for the life support if that is the situation or don't go if that is the situation. And when we need to decide, obey the order and ask your father and older brother as your father and older brother are the main decision makers while you have to comfort your younger brothers as that is your role. And since we are all spiritual beings and as declared last Sunday, God is everywhere, so let's hold on to God, who will remember and receive all the prayers you have with the mourning of salvation regardless of whether she is conscious or not. In the end, as long as we do our best for salvation by prayers and sharing the Word, the repentance and salvation of her will be accomplished by God's full work. The reason why you are still seeking the proof of her salvation is because you are still in self-effort without full trust in God. And the salvation that will be achieved through this event is not only for your mother, but also for those who are left that it is the salvation of someone in your family, it could be your father, or brothers."
