# I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. - Galatians 2:20 {#index}

I'd be the moon so I can reflect the shine from God on you during your darkest hours.

# Feb. 1, 2020 - Being humble acknowledging my weakness with faith in Jesus saves me.

The event of Jairus's sick daughter reveals that his religious rituals, and the law, the old values, cannot save a person. Jairus released his pride and fell to Jesus, the gospel, the new values, asking Him to save his daughter. As Jesus came to earth, He now saves people with the new gospel, the new wineskins, not the old law, the old wineskins. A woman with bleeding for 12 years and a 12-year-old daughter of Jairus,  are experiencing the gospel of Jesus. 12 is the perfect number, indicating that the limit of life, the time of salvation, has come near.

- And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, he pours new wine into new wineskins." - Mark 2:22

- Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her. - Luke 8:41-43

A woman with bleeding disease was isolated from society because of her illness, and she lost the sense of security that comes from belonging to a community and the safety that comes from possessing as she spent her fortune to cure her illness. Unlike Jairus, who fell down to Jesus, she recognized her humble state after losing her basic desires of safety and security, and she did not dare to come to Jesus. Instead, she came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of His cloak in secret. The woman's behavior at the time was a level of assault, because according to the law, contact with a sick person is unclean leading to separation for a while from the society. But Jesus calls her actions as faith, not assault. Her fear for people is turning into awe for God after being healed. Jesus calls the woman daughter and she is the only one being called daughter throughout the Bible. By believing in Jesus, we have a new identity and become children and daughters of God. Jesus now touches her wounds of insecurity that have been lost in isolation by publicly calling a woman out of a prison alone and proclaiming her return to community. Peace is now upon the woman who is a child and daughter of God by faith. There were many who touched Jesus, but only this woman of faith was healed and called  daughter by Jesus. When I come to Jesus with faith and thorough acknowledgment of my humbleness and incompetence, my sickness is healed, peace comes, and I become a child of God.

- Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God--John 1:12

- She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped...Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace." - Luck 8: 44,47-48

# Jan. 31, 2020 - Jesus came to me through persecuting family. 

Gerasenes was a land of Judea bordering neighbor countries where Jews were making money by raising pigs used as offerings of foreign gods of the neighbor countries although pigs were unclean animals to Jews. There was a demonized man bothering the Jews in the land. Likewise there is a demonized and persecuting family next to me because of my hesitation between God and the world at the border. Only for this demon possessed man, Jesus came through the storm. The gospel is engraved in my heart when I pay the price of a large herd of pigs for the free grace of my salvation. To the healed man, Jesus told to return home and tell his family the great things God has done to him. Jesus came to me through my father, who caused financial struggling to my family and my mother, who was confused by different faith while I was hesitating at the boundary between God and the world of success. The Gospel was minded in my heart through losing my job, and paying the price of my mother's cancer. God tells me to go back to my family and tell the gospel to my brothers and father who don't know God yet.

- One day Jesus said to his disciples, "Let's go over to the other side of the lake." So they got into a boat and set out. As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger...They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee....When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned....The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, "Return home and tell how much God has done for you." So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him. - Luke 8:22,23,26,33,38,39

# Jan. 30, 2020 - True love for family.

We should overcome the family idols. Faith and family are separate. Family idols can be an obstacle to faith. Family is not the idols we depend on but the ones we share the gospel for their salvation. We should look at our family objectively like Jesus did. 

- Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you." He replied, "My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice." - Luke 7:20-21

What is it to love family or people? Is it love to listen to their wishes and grant their obsessions based on their own greed? Or is it love to pray for them and help them depend on God, not me? Still, keeping my heart somewhere else and trying to accommodate their obsessive needs is not love but more betrayal. Wouldn't it be a true love to recognize my irreversible heart and weakness, leave it to God, go forward with hope that God will work, and pray for the salvation of them? Nevertheless, the focus should be on the grace of God and salvation, not on physical or emotional help for their needs. Real salvation is not to give bread to the lame for the temporal satisfaction of his need, but for him to rise, go to the temple, and praise God as Peter did to the lame. For we live by Word not by bread. 

- Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" - Matt 4:4

- He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your fathers had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD. - Duet 8:3

- Now a man crippled from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts. When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money. Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, "Look at us!" So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them. Then Peter said, "Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk." Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong. He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God. - Act 3


# Jan. 29, 2020 - Acknowledging weakness and bring it to God while expecting His work for salvation. 

It is good to feel pity and compassion for people, but above all, think of their salvation first. More importantly, whether they are really closer to God and more dependent on God rather than their emotional or physical pains. Even if their hearts hurt, it's only a moment, and if they rely more on God through this event, it becomes an event of salvation. 

All things are possible with God. But since each of us has its own level of faith at the moment, it is often difficult for us to keep what is right. It is on going process that we become growing in spirit. We do our best to keep the word of God, and what is right, but nevertheless, we should acknowledge our weakness that sometimes we fail to keep it and expect God to work through it. We grow further through this process. The more we focus on our effort, the more desperate and heavier we will feel. We should no longer condemn ourselves for our weakness, rather bring it to God and expect how God is going to work and enjoy grace and freedom.

1. What is the definition of becoming righteous? Not by committing no sin but by faith. We can hurt people. We can keep falling and sinning. But this cannot affect the fact that we are righteous because It is considered righteous by faith. For we are bound to sin and keep failing to do the right things. 

- being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.” The words “it was credited to him” were written not for him alone, but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness–for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification. - Romans 4:21-25

2. My actions and desires can hurt people. Jacob's desire for birthright hurt his brother, Esau as much as he wanted to kill Jacob. Tamar's desire to belong to God's people made adultery for his father-in-law, left a great wound for Judah. Rahab craving for God, killed all her people. While Jacob, Tamar, and Rahab were longing for God's kingdom and spiritual blessings and hurting people at the same time, but David's lust for Bathsheba was not just hurting, but even killed Uriah, the husband of her. Jacob escaped from his brother, sanctified through his rugged life enough to bless the King of Egypt at his older age. Tamar became the symbol of the blessing of giving birth to a spiritual child, and Judah became Israel's spiritual firstborn through the shameful event of sleeping with his daughter in law, the turning point of his life. Rahab, the gentile and prostitute, gave birth to Boaz and became the ancestor of Jesus, also she saved his family. David also gave birth to Solomon through Bathsheba and continued the spiritual lineage of Jesus. Those are the images of our daily lives like Jesus' forefather, Jacob, Judah, Tamar, Rahab, and David that they are not any better than us when it comes to weakness and sins. It is important to admit that we are as weak as we know what is right but cannot keep it and continue to sin. We must bring our weakness to God.

3. Our weakness and falling event sometimes becomes an event to be necessary and an event of salvation. Jacob's desire of seeking spiritual blessings or David's desire to satisfy his lust eventually served to become more holy, experience the grace of God and spiritual growth. At the end, we can expect God to work together with our weakness for good and how God is going to sanctify us through these events.

# Jan. 28, 2020 - Forgiven, so we love God. 
 
A woman still living in sin had already heard about Jesus, and she had received the grace of His word, and she had the opportunity to meet Him in person finally. By loving Jesus with gratitude for the grace received, she breaks the expensive perfume and washes Jesus' feet with it. Jesus publicly declares that the sin of a woman is forgiven. 

It is not that I have been forgiven of my sins because I love God, but that I have already been forgiven freely by grace first, and I love God as a result. As the story of the two men forgiven the debt, the debt was already forgiven freely by grace. Likewise, my sins have already been forgiven by the blood of Jesus. All I have to do is to believe it and love God. To the woman forgiven by faith, Jesus tells her to go in peace. But even after the remission of sins, the woman's environment will remain the same with shame and humiliation. However, she can now be at peace with faith in Jesus, not in environment or humanity condemnation anymore. Jesus showed that He did not judge or condemn our weakness, nor our sins, but more focus on our physical and spiritual needs. Later, when we stand for judgement before God, He will see how much we loved God and neighbor, not how much we sinned as Jesus showed us when He was here.  

- When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume,...Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?"...Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven--for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little." Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven." The other guests began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?" Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace." - Luke 7:37, 42, 47-50

- being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. This is why "it was credited to him as righteousness." The words "it was credited to him" were written not for him alone, but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness--for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification. - Romans 4:21-25

 
# Jan. 18, 2020 - God prepares my salvation knowing my weakness. 
 
I meditated on Jacob, who deceived his brother, Esau, and ran away. Isaac, the father, tried to bless Esau, but Jacob deceived his father and got blessed. Jacob was running away from the angry Esau who tried to kill Jacob. Esau was clearly a victim. But God was with Jacob. If Jacob had not lied and deceived, Esau would have been blessed, so would Esau, not Jacob, become the father of God's people? It seems that God already knew the end and chose Jacob from the beginning. God already knew the nature of Jacob, who lied and deceived, and God completed his salvation in consideration of Jacob's free will. Likewise, God knows my good, the weak, the sin, the failure, everything that is going to happen, and leads me in a good way under His plan. 

- His father Isaac asked him, "Who are you?" "I am your son," he answered, "your firstborn, Esau." Isaac trembled violently and said, "Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him--and indeed he will be blessed!" When Esau heard his father's words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, "Bless me--me too, my father!" But he said, "Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing." - Genesis 27:32-35

- And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. - Romans 8:28


God (who chose Jacob from the beginning, using his weaknesses, and his free will to complete his salvation) knew what I would choose and how I would fail, and He had already set up a plan for it. At the time of the creation of heaven and earth, knowing that Adam and Eve would fall, and people couldn't keep the law, God were already telling the serpent that He would send Jesus to the earth to crush his head. Six hundred years before Jesus was born, God spoke more specifically through Isaiah. And as He said, Jesus came. 

- And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel." - Genesis 3:15

- Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel. - Isaiah 7:14

- "The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel"--which means, "God with us." - Matt 1:23


Before Peter was still growing up, despite his weakness, Jesus said that Peter would open the kingdom of God with the key of heaven. He also knew that Peter would deny Him three times, and through this event He raised and disciplined Peter, who would be greatly used as an Apostle with the key of heaven. After the resurrection, Jesus met Peter and asked him three times, do you love me? Peter was born again from the icon of despair as the holy and mighty apostle of God. God knows everything, my weaknesses, my failures, my sins that I would make in the future, and my end, and has already made plans to use them for my salvation and leading me in good ways. 

- And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven." - Matt 16:18-19

- But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven. - Matt 10:33

- Peter replied, "Man, I don't know what you're talking about!" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly. - Luke 22:60-62

- When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?" "Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my lambs." Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep." The third time he said to him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" He said, "Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you." - John 21:15-17


Later, God reluctantly gave a king to the Israelites as they had asked a king eagerly, but God had already prophesied to their forefather Jacob that kings would come from him. Timeless God already knows everything. God knows what choice I will make, my weakness, my failures, and my ends. Because He knows the end, it is certain that the Words of prophecy will be fulfilled, and we can therefore believe that all that God says will be fulfilled. Whenever I found that God prophesied knowing what is going to happen in the future, and the prophecies in the past were fulfilled later in the Bible, I feel God is amazing and reliable. My faith in God, who already knows my future and end, is growing in this regard.

- And God said to him, "I am God Almighty ; be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will come from your body. - Genesis 35:11

- They said to him, "You are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways; now appoint a king to lead us, such as all the other nations have." But when they said, "Give us a king to lead us," this displeased Samuel; so he prayed to the LORD. And the LORD told him: "Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king. - 1Samuel 8:5-7

> God knows your end, how you die, and what you will do rest of your life as well as your family. Don't worry, just leave them to God. Just enjoy His grace by  doing your best to fully trust Him, which pleases Him too. He knows your end and has prepared the plan for your salvation considering your weakness and mistakes. Everything happening has reasons. Let's trust Him. One thing for sure, you were chosen! 

> My brother talked to the leader in the church yesterday about keeping the life support or just giving up and let her go to heaven. She said nobody knows what is the way of salvation. Her father died after receiving ten days of life support. The resident doctor told her that he had to do what he had to do the best, because he had seen a lot of miracles. But after trying what he could do for 10 days, her father died. 

> "Likewise, all we have to do is not to make plans for what's going to happen in the future, but stay true to the present considering the situation where you go for the life support if that is the situation or don't go if that is the situation. And when we need to decide, obey the order and ask your father and older brother as your father and older brother are the main decision makers while you have to comfort your younger brothers as that is your role. And since we are all spiritual beings and as declared last Sunday, God is everywhere, so let's hold on to God, who will remember and receive all the prayers you have with the mourning of salvation regardless of whether she is conscious or not. In the end, as long as we do our best for salvation by prayers and sharing the Word, the repentance and salvation of her will be accomplished by God's full work. The reason why you are still seeking the proof of her salvation is because you are still in self-effort without full trust in God. And the salvation that will be achieved through this event is not only for your mother, but also for those who are left that it is the salvation of someone in your family, it could be your father, or brothers."
