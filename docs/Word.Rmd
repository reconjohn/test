# I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. - Galatians 2:20 {#index}

I'd be the moon so I can reflect the shine from God on you during your darkest hours.

# Jan. 28, 2020 - Forgiven, so we love God. 
 
A woman still living in sin had already heard about Jesus, and she had received the grace of His word, and she had the opportunity to meet Him in person finally. By loving Jesus with gratitude for the grace received, she breaks the expensive perfume and washes Jesus' feet with it. Jesus publicly declares that the sin of a woman is forgiven. 

It is not that I have been forgiven of my sins because I love God, but that I have already been forgiven freely by grace first, and I love God as a result. As the story of the two men forgiven the debt, the debt was already forgiven freely by grace. Likewise, my sins have already been forgiven by the blood of Jesus. All I have to do is to believe it and love God. To the woman forgiven by faith, Jesus tells her to go in peace. But even after the remission of sins, the woman's environment will remain the same with shame and humiliation. However, she can now be at peace with faith in Jesus, not in environment or humanity condemnation anymore. Jesus showed that He did not judge or condemn our weakness, nor our sins, but more focus on our physical and spiritual needs. Later, when we stand for judgement before God, He will see how much we loved God and neighbor, not how much we sinned as Jesus showed us when He was here.  

- When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume,...Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?"...Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven--for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little." Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven." The other guests began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?" Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace." - Luke 7:37, 42, 47-50

- being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. This is why "it was credited to him as righteousness." The words "it was credited to him" were written not for him alone, but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness--for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification. - Romans 4:21-25

 
# Jan. 18, 2020 - God prepares my salvation knowing my weakness. 
 
I meditated on Jacob, who deceived his brother, Esau, and ran away. Isaac, the father, tried to bless Esau, but Jacob deceived his father and got blessed. Jacob was running away from the angry Esau who tried to kill Jacob. Esau was clearly a victim. But God was with Jacob. If Jacob had not lied and deceived, Esau would have been blessed, so would Esau, not Jacob, become the father of God's people? It seems that God already knew the end and chose Jacob from the beginning. God already knew the nature of Jacob, who lied and deceived, and God completed his salvation in consideration of Jacob's free will. Likewise, God knows my good, the weak, the sin, the failure, everything that is going to happen, and leads me in a good way under His plan. 

- His father Isaac asked him, "Who are you?" "I am your son," he answered, "your firstborn, Esau." Isaac trembled violently and said, "Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him--and indeed he will be blessed!" When Esau heard his father's words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, "Bless me--me too, my father!" But he said, "Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing." - Genesis 27:32-35

- And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. - Romans 8:28


God (who chose Jacob from the beginning, using his weaknesses, and his free will to complete his salvation) knew what I would choose and how I would fail, and He had already set up a plan for it. At the time of the creation of heaven and earth, knowing that Adam and Eve would fall, and people couldn't keep the law, God were already telling the serpent that He would send Jesus to the earth to crush his head. Six hundred years before Jesus was born, God spoke more specifically through Isaiah. And as He said, Jesus came. 

- And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel." - Genesis 3:15

- Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel. - Isaiah 7:14

- "The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel"--which means, "God with us." - Matt 1:23


Before Peter was still growing up, despite his weakness, Jesus said that Peter would open the kingdom of God with the key of heaven. He also knew that Peter would deny Him three times, and through this event He raised and disciplined Peter, who would be greatly used as an Apostle with the key of heaven. After the resurrection, Jesus met Peter and asked him three times, do you love me? Peter was born again from the icon of despair as the holy and mighty apostle of God. God knows everything, my weaknesses, my failures, my sins that I would make in the future, and my end, and has already made plans to use them for my salvation and leading me in good ways. 

- And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven." - Matt 16:18-19

- But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven. - Matt 10:33

- Peter replied, "Man, I don't know what you're talking about!" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly. - Luke 22:60-62

- When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?" "Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my lambs." Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep." The third time he said to him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" He said, "Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you." - John 21:15-17


Later, God reluctantly gave a king to the Israelites as they had asked a king eagerly, but God had already prophesied to their forefather Jacob that kings would come from him. Timeless God already knows everything. God knows what choice I will make, my weakness, my failures, and my ends. Because He knows the end, it is certain that the Words of prophecy will be fulfilled, and we can therefore believe that all that God says will be fulfilled. Whenever I found that God prophesied knowing what is going to happen in the future, and the prophecies in the past were fulfilled later in the Bible, I feel God is amazing and reliable. My faith in God, who already knows my future and end, is growing in this regard.

- And God said to him, "I am God Almighty ; be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will come from your body. - Genesis 35:11

- They said to him, "You are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways; now appoint a king to lead us, such as all the other nations have." But when they said, "Give us a king to lead us," this displeased Samuel; so he prayed to the LORD. And the LORD told him: "Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king. - 1Samuel 8:5-7

> God knows your end, how you die, and what you will do rest of your life as well as your family. Don't worry, just leave them to God. Just enjoy His grace by  doing your best to fully trust Him, which pleases Him too. He knows your end and has prepared the plan for your salvation considering your weakness and mistakes. Everything happening has reasons. Let's trust Him. One thing for sure, you were chosen! 

> My brother talked to the leader in the church yesterday about keeping the life support or just giving up and let her go to heaven. She said nobody knows what is the way of salvation. Her father died after receiving ten days of life support. The resident doctor told her that he had to do what he had to do the best, because he had seen a lot of miracles. But after trying what he could do for 10 days, her father died. 

> "Likewise, all we have to do is not to make plans for what's going to happen in the future, but stay true to the present considering the situation where you go for the life support if that is the situation or don't go if that is the situation. And when we need to decide, obey the order and ask your father and older brother as your father and older brother are the main decision makers while you have to comfort your younger brothers as that is your role. And since we are all spiritual beings and as declared last Sunday, God is everywhere, so let's hold on to God, who will remember and receive all the prayers you have with the mourning of salvation regardless of whether she is conscious or not. In the end, as long as we do our best for salvation by prayers and sharing the Word, the repentance and salvation of her will be accomplished by God's full work. The reason why you are still seeking the proof of her salvation is because you are still in self-effort without full trust in God. And the salvation that will be achieved through this event is not only for your mother, but also for those who are left that it is the salvation of someone in your family, it could be your father, or brothers."
