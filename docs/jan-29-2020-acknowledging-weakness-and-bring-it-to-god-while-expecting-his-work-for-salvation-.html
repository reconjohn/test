<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Jan. 29, 2020 - Acknowledging weakness and bring it to God while expecting His work for salvation.</h1>
<p>It is good to feel pity and compassion for people, but above all, think of their salvation first. More importantly, whether they are really closer to God and more dependent on God rather than their emotional or physical pains. Even if their hearts hurt, it’s only a moment, and if they rely more on God through this event, it becomes an event of salvation.</p>
<p>All things are possible with God. But since each of us has its own level of faith at the moment, it is often difficult for us to keep what is right. It is on going process that we become growing in spirit. We do our best to keep the word of God, and what is right, but nevertheless, we should acknowledge our weakness that sometimes we fail to keep it and expect God to work through it. We grow further through this process. The more we focus on our effort, the more desperate and heavier we will feel. We should no longer condemn ourselves for our weakness, rather bring it to God and expect how God is going to work and enjoy grace and freedom.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the definition of becoming righteous? Not by committing no sin but by faith. We can hurt people. We can keep falling and sinning. But this cannot affect the fact that we are righteous because It is considered righteous by faith. For we are bound to sin and keep failing to do the right things.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.” The words “it was credited to him” were written not for him alone, but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness–for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification. - Romans 4:21-25</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>My actions and desires can hurt people. Jacob’s desire for birthright hurt his brother, Esau as much as he wanted to kill Jacob. Tamar’s desire to belong to God’s people made adultery for his father-in-law, left a great wound for Judah. Rahab craving for God, killed all her people. While Jacob, Tamar, and Rahab were longing for God’s kingdom and spiritual blessings and hurting people at the same time, but David’s lust for Bathsheba was not just hurting, but even killed Uriah, the husband of her. Jacob escaped from his brother, sanctified through his rugged life enough to bless the King of Egypt at his older age. Tamar became the symbol of the blessing of giving birth to a spiritual child, and Judah became Israel’s spiritual firstborn through the shameful event of sleeping with his daughter in law, the turning point of his life. Rahab, the gentile and prostitute, gave birth to Boaz and became the ancestor of Jesus, also she saved his family. David also gave birth to Solomon through Bathsheba and continued the spiritual lineage of Jesus. Those are the images of our daily lives like Jesus’ forefather, Jacob, Judah, Tamar, Rahab, and David that they are not any better than us when it comes to weakness and sins. It is important to admit that we are as weak as we know what is right but cannot keep it and continue to sin. We must bring our weakness to God.</p></li>
<li><p>Our weakness and falling event sometimes becomes an event to be necessary and an event of salvation. Jacob’s desire of seeking spiritual blessings or David’s desire to satisfy his lust eventually served to become more holy, experience the grace of God and spiritual growth. At the end, we can expect God to work together with our weakness for good and how God is going to sanctify us through these events.</p></li>
