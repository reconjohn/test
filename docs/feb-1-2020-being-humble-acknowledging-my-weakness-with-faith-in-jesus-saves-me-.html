<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Feb. 1, 2020 - Being humble acknowledging my weakness with faith in Jesus saves me.</h1>
<p>The event of Jairus’s sick daughter reveals that his religious rituals, and the law, the old values, cannot save a person. Jairus released his pride and fell to Jesus, the gospel, the new values, asking Him to save his daughter. As Jesus came to earth, He now saves people with the new gospel, the new wineskins, not the old law, the old wineskins. A woman with bleeding for 12 years and a 12-year-old daughter of Jairus, are experiencing the gospel of Jesus. 12 is the perfect number, indicating that the limit of life, the time of salvation, has come near.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, he pours new wine into new wineskins." - Mark 2:22</p></li>
<li><p>Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus’ feet, pleading with him to come to his house because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her. - Luke 8:41-43</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A woman with bleeding disease was isolated from society because of her illness, and she lost the sense of security that comes from belonging to a community and the safety that comes from possessing as she spent her fortune to cure her illness. Unlike Jairus, who fell down to Jesus, she recognized her humble state after losing her basic desires of safety and security, and she did not dare to come to Jesus. Instead, she came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of His cloak in secret. The woman’s behavior at the time was a level of assault, because according to the law, contact with a sick person is unclean leading to separation for a while from the society. But Jesus calls her actions as faith, not assault. Her fear for people is turning into awe for God after being healed. Jesus calls the woman daughter and she is the only one being called daughter throughout the Bible. By believing in Jesus, we have a new identity and become children and daughters of God. Jesus now touches her wounds of insecurity that have been lost in isolation by publicly calling a woman out of a prison alone and proclaiming her return to community. Peace is now upon the woman who is a child and daughter of God by faith. There were many who touched Jesus, but only this woman of faith was healed and called daughter by Jesus. When I come to Jesus with faith and thorough acknowledgment of my humbleness and incompetence, my sickness is healed, peace comes, and I become a child of God.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God–John 1:12</p></li>
<li><p>She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped…Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. Then he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.” - Luck 8: 44,47-48</p></li>
