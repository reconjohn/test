<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Jan. 30, 2020 - True love for family.</h1>
<p>We should overcome the family idols. Faith and family are separate. Family idols can be an obstacle to faith. Family is not the idols we depend on but the ones we share the gospel for their salvation. We should look at our family objectively like Jesus did.</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.” He replied, “My mother and brothers are those who hear God’s word and put it into practice.” - Luke 7:20-21</li>
</ul>
<p>What is it to love family or people? Is it love to listen to their wishes and grant their obsessions based on their own greed? Or is it love to pray for them and help them depend on God, not me? Still, keeping my heart somewhere else and trying to accommodate their obsessive needs is not love but more betrayal. Wouldn’t it be a true love to recognize my irreversible heart and weakness, leave it to God, go forward with hope that God will work, and pray for the salvation of them? Nevertheless, the focus should be on the grace of God and salvation, not on physical or emotional help for their needs. Real salvation is not to give bread to the lame for the temporal satisfaction of his need, but for him to rise, go to the temple, and praise God as Peter did to the lame. For we live by Word not by bread.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’” - Matt 4:4</p></li>
<li><p>He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your fathers had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD. - Duet 8:3</p></li>
<li><p>Now a man crippled from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts. When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money. Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, “Look at us!” So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them. Then Peter said, “Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.” Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man’s feet and ankles became strong. He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God. - Act 3</p></li>
