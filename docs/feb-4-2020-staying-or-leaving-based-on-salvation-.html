<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Feb. 4, 2020 - Staying or leaving based on salvation.</h1>
<p>Jesus goes to Bethsaida, the hometown of the fishermen, Peter, Andrew and Phillip, so that the disciples who return after evangelism can rest, but people, who desperately need Jesus for their sake, do not leave them alone. Luke chapter 4 shows the different image of Jesus who left people to preach the gospel in the other town, and chapter 5 shows Jesus moved to a secluded place to pray when the crowd came. We should know that there are times to leave and to stay like Jesus for salvation. Even if I will get gold, if it does not help salvation, I must leave. Even if suffering comes, if it helps salvation, I must stay. When salvation becomes the purpose, there are times when what is always right is not right, and what is not right is right.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida, but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing. - Luke 9:10-11</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking reasonably and rationally is different from having faith in Jesus who can do everything. Jesus focuses on bringing up the disciples by emphasizing faith and showing the miracle. Even if what I have seems a little, Jesus tells me to bring it. This results in abundant overflow. What do I have to feed people today?</p>
<ul>
<li>He replied, “You give them something to eat.” They answered, “We have only five loaves of bread and two fish–unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.”…Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to set before the people. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. - Luke 9:13, 16-17</li>
</ul>
